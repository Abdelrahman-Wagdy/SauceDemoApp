# Mobile Automation Testing Framework

## üöÄ Cross-Platform SDK & App Testing with Appium

This project delivers a scalable mobile automation testing framework built to validate mobile applications and SDKs across Android and iOS platforms. It is designed with modularity, flexibility, and reusability in mind, making it ideal for companies who want reliable automation that saves both time and costs.

## üåü Key Highlights

- Cross-Platform Support: One framework for both Android and iOS.

- Plug-and-Play Architecture: Easily extend tests by adding new pages and services.

- Factory Design Pattern: Centralized driver management for scalability.

- Seamless Appium Server Control: Automatic start/stop of Appium servers.

- Reusable Components: Shared helpers for actions, waits, and test data handling.

- Parallel Execution: Faster test cycles using TestNG parallel runs.

- Professional Reporting: Integrated with Allure Reports for visual test insights.

## üì± Supported Platforms

- Android: Automated tests on emulators and physical devices.

- iOS: Automated tests on simulators and real devices.

Configurations are defined in a simple JSON file (config.json) so the framework adapts easily to new environments without code changes.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technology Stack

- Appium ‚Äì Mobile automation engine.

- Java ‚Äì Core programming language.

- TestNG ‚Äì Test execution & parallel runs.

- Allure ‚Äì Rich, interactive test reporting.

## üîÑ How It Works

1. Configuration: Define devices, OS versions, and apps in config.json.

2. Driver Setup: The DriverFactory automatically selects Android or iOS.

3. Appium Server: Managed seamlessly by the framework, no manual steps required.

4. Tests: Written once, executed across multiple platforms using TestNG (testng.xml).

5. Reports: Generate Allure Reports for visual insights into each test run.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Tests

Tests can be executed directly via TestNG or with Maven:

```
mvn clean test
```

Choose which platform to run (android or ios) through testng.xml.

üìä Reporting

After a test run, generate a professional Allure report:

```
allure serve target/allure-results
```

Reports include:

- Test pass/fail status.

- Execution timeline.

- Device & environment details.

- Screenshots on failure.

## üîÆ Future Extensions

- CI/CD integration with Jenkins / GitHub Actions.

- Support for hybrid apps and web mobile testing.

- Data-driven and behavior-driven test approaches.

- Cloud device support (BrowserStack, SauceLabs).

## ‚úÖ Why This Matters for You

- Save Time: Automates repetitive test flows across multiple platforms.

- Save Costs: One framework for both Android & iOS reduces duplication.

- Professional Reports: Clear evidence of quality for stakeholders.

- Scalable Design: Ready for future growth and integration with CI/CD pipelines.

‚ú® This framework ensures **your app or SDK performs consistently** across platforms ‚Äî giving your business confidence, speed, and quality in every release.
